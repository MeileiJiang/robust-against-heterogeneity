Data variation and heterogeneity
===================================================================
Data variation dues to lots of factors:

- modeled factors (primary variables)
- unmodeled factors (batch effects)
- random sampling variation (white noise) 

Data matrix **$X$**  =  (**$x_1$**, \dots, **$x_m$**) , and $x_i$ = $(x_{i1}, \dots, x_{in}), i = 1, \dots, m.$
